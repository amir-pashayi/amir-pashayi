# Hello, I'm Amir Pashayi 👨‍💻
I'm a passionate **Backend Developer** focused on **Python**, **Django**, and building robust, scalable APIs.

### 👨‍🏫 About Me

I'm currently a student at Farhangian University, studying **Elementary Education**.  
Alongside my university courses and internships in schools, I’ve been teaching programming at **TaifGostar**, an educational company focused on coding skills — and I’ve been with them for over 2 years now.

Although I started coding a few years ago, my main focus was always on learning and teaching — not building flashy projects.  
That’s changing now: I’m sharpening my **backend development** skills with a strong focus on **Django** and **DRF**, and building solid, clean APIs.

> Not a fan of frontend 😄 — backend is where I thrive.
